- 👋 Hi, I’m @jgonzalez810 aka Jordon! I live in the US and I am just starting out on my coding journey!
- 👀 I'm a pretty relateable person that is trying to create balance in life. Netflix + hiking; video games + comedy shows; cooking + Taco Bell etc. Building this life and going on this journey with my husband and our toddler has created the most wonderful imbalance of love and support and I'm here for it!
- 🌱 Currently I am learning the building blocks of Javascript, HTML and CSS for Front End Development. I am also interested in learning more about Ruby and Rails.
- 💞️ My focus right now is to find apprenticeship opportunities for front-end development hands on learning or entry level jobs with tech companies so I can immerse myself in the field while I learn more.
- 📫 You can find me on Twitter @jgonzalez_dev or check out my Linkedin profile. I'm familiarizing myself with Github and hope to start bringing my projects over to start creating my portfolio. 
- 🤷🏾‍♀️  I am always so open to help and feedback from those in the field. If I ever come off as looking like I know what I'm doing, trust me I'm not. Right now, its not the imposter syndrome talking, its the truth so please send help or advice my way. It will be very appreciated. Thanks! </>
